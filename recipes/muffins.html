    <h3>Quick and easy to make and simply delicious!</h3>
    <p>The tops of these muffins have a crunchy sugar crust for a lovely contrast of texture in each bite.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>: This moist chocolate chip muffin recipe starts with milk.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>: Instead of butter, this recipe calls for a neutral oil (such as vegetable oil).</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg lends moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the batter structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugars</strong>: You'll need white and brown sugars for this sweet recipe. </li>
        <li><strong>Baking Powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the muffins, but it won't make them taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong>: Of course, you'll need chocolate chips! </li>

    </ul>
