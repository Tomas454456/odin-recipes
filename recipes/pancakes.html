    <h3>Thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes.</h3>
    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think.</p>
    <p>with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff). </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Powder</strong>: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong> and <strong>Butter</strong>: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together. </li>
    </ul>
